# hello-world

I am a Network Engineer that is trying to learn more about automation and keep up with the everchanging world of information technology. I have a Bachelor's degree from Western Kentucky University in Computer Information Technology, am a CCNA, and have been in the industry for almost five years now.

I started as a support technician, as most people do, and eventually worked my way up to a Network Engineer position in the company as people left and/or changed roles. I recently started making Python scripts to help do simple and mundane, yet time consuming tasks, quicker. Some of the scripts I have made have saved myself and my coworkers a lot of time and freed us up to complete more important projects. I hope to continue this education and become a more efficient scripter and, in turn, a more efficient engineer.
